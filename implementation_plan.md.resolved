# PDF Splitting Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Split a source PDF into two separate PDF files:
1. `text_only.pdf`: Contains all extracted text, preserving layout as much as possible, with no images.
2. `images_only.pdf`: Contains all extracted images, preserving layout, with no text.

## Proposed Changes

## Proposed Changes

### [Web Application]
#### [NEW] [app.py](file:///Users/vidyadhar/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c29a6940-ccd7-46dc-a7fb-df5f0fa55bc4/app.py)
- Flask application.
- Routes:
  - `/`: Renders upload form.
  - `/upload`: Handles file POST, runs logic, returns download links.
  - `/download/<filename>`: Serves processed files.

#### [NEW] [templates/index.html](file:///Users/vidyadhar/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c29a6940-ccd7-46dc-a7fb-df5f0fa55bc4/templates/index.html)
- Modern, clean, "platform" aesthetic.
- Drag and drop file upload zone.
- "Split Document" button.
- Results section showing "Download Text-Only" and "Download Images-Only".

#### [NEW] [static/style.css](file:///Users/vidyadhar/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c29a6940-ccd7-46dc-a7fb-df5f0fa55bc4/static/style.css)
- Premium look and feel (Vanila CSS).
- Glassmorphism effects.
- Responsive layout.

### [Data Processing]
#### [MODIFY] [split_pdf.py](file:///Users/vidyadhar/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c29a6940-ccd7-46dc-a7fb-df5f0fa55bc4/split_pdf.py)
- Refactor [split_pdf](file:///Users/vidyadhar/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c29a6940-ccd7-46dc-a7fb-df5f0fa55bc4/split_pdf.py#5-51) function to return paths of generated files instead of printing.
- Ensure it works with the Flask upload folder structure.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- None (Visual/Manual verification prioritized for UI).

### Manual Verification
1. Start Flask app: `python app.py`.
2. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in browser.
3. Upload a sample PDF.
4. Click "Split".
5. Verify two download buttons appear.
6. Download and inspect both files.
